# 50-sql-queries

This repository is based on a LinkedIn post by [Tajamul Khan],  
who shared a collection of **50 SQL interview queries** frequently used for analytical and technical interviews.

I have used these queries as a **learning reference** and applied them to the  
**AdventureWorks2020** sample database in order to practice solving real business-related questions  
using SQL.  

Each query has been adapted, tested, and documented with the goal of improving both  
technical proficiency and business problem-solving skills.
